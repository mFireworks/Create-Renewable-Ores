# Create Renewable Ores

This is a fork of [Create Renewable Ores](https://github.com/CodeF53/Create-Renewable-Ores) by F53. This brings the pack up to 1.20.1 and makes some adjustments from the original.

## Modifications

- Changed Deepslate recipe to result in Cobbled Deepslate

### Original README

A Datapack/Mod for [Create Farbic](https://modrinth.com/mod/create-fabric) that adds renewable recipes for crimsite, ochrum, veridium, and asurine.

These can be crushed to iron/gold/zinc/copper, thus renewable ores.

Recipes based on [CreatePlus](https://github.com/JieningYu/CreatePlus-mod/)'s, with slight modification.
